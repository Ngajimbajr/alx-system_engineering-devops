Postmortem: Web Application Outage Incident
Issue Summary:
Duration: February 21, 2024, 09:30 AM - February 21, 2024, 11:45 AM (UTC)
Impact: The outage affected approximately 30% of our users who were unable to access the messaging feature of our web application, experiencing prolonged loading times and intermittent errors.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the database connection pooling settings led to a bottleneck in database connections, causing the application to become unresponsive.
Timeline:
09:30 AM (UTC): The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a spike in latency for database queries.
09:35 AM: Engineers noticed an increase in error rates and user complaints regarding slow performance.
09:40 AM: Initial investigations focused on the application servers and network infrastructure, assuming a potential issue with the application code or network congestion.
10:00 AM: Debugging efforts led to examining database performance metrics, suspecting database overload as the root cause.
10:30 AM: Attempts to scale up database resources were made but did not alleviate the issue.
11:00 AM: The incident was escalated to the database administration team for further investigation.
11:45 AM: The misconfiguration in the database connection pooling settings was identified and corrected, restoring normal operation of the application.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was determined to be a misconfiguration in the database connection pooling settings, leading to an excessive number of open connections and subsequent database overload.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by adjusting the database connection pooling settings to ensure optimal utilization of resources and prevent a bottleneck in database connections.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated monitoring and alerting for database connection pool usage to detect anomalies early.
Enhance the incident response process to include database administration team collaboration for faster resolution of database-related issues.
Tasks:
Review and update database connection pooling settings to align with best practices.
Conduct a comprehensive audit of database configurations to identify and address any potential misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide better visibility into database performance metrics.
Schedule regular training sessions for engineering teams to ensure awareness of best practices for database management and troubleshooting.
